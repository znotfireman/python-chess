# Chess

Mostly fully fledged chess in python in 2 days. Made by SSIS student Bill
Nguyen, class of '2028, to demonstrate I am capable of skipping AP Computer
Science Principles and be recommended to AP Computer Science A for the 2025-26
school year.

If you're the SSIS staff, see the email I sent :)
